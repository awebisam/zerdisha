# Personal Exploration Engine (PEEngine)

PEEngine is a terminal-based interactive learning tool that serves as a **personal cognitive exoskeleton** for exploring topics, mapping conceptual connections, and refining mental models through AI-guided Socratic dialogue.

## Core Philosophy

- **Exploration over Answers**: AI guides discovery rather than providing direct answers
- **Metaphorical Reasoning**: Uses metaphors as bridges between domains and concepts  
- **Graph-based Memory**: Every concept and connection stored in Neo4j knowledge graph
- **Metacognitive Awareness**: System monitors and adjusts its own behavior based on learning patterns

## Key Features

- **Socratic Dialogue**: AI never gives direct answers, uses metaphors as primary communication
- **Knowledge Graph**: Stores u-vectors (personal understanding) and c-vectors (canonical knowledge)
- **Three-Agent Architecture**: Conversational Agent (CA), Pattern Detector (PD), Metacognitive Agent (MA)
- **Session Management**: Contiguous explorations with save/review capabilities
- **Cross-domain Connections**: Maps metaphorical patterns across different knowledge domains

## Target User

This is a **personal learning experiment** built specifically for @awebisam's cognitive structure. Not applicable for general users - modeled around one person's learning patterns and philosophical framework.

## Current Status

Experimental learning tool implementing full Typer CLI with interactive sessions, Neo4j graph storage, three-agent architecture, and rich TUI conversation flow.
