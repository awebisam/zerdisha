# PEEngine Core Solidification - Validation Checklist

## Quick Validation Checklist

This checklist provides a rapid way to verify all three core features are working correctly.

### Environment Setup ✓
- [ ] `.env` file configured with Azure OpenAI credentials
- [ ] Docker containers running: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] PEEngine installed: `peengine --help` works
- [ ] Databases accessible: Neo4j (localhost:7474), MongoDB (localhost:8081)

### Core Feature Validation

#### 1. Gap Check Feature ✓
**Quick Test**: 
```bash
peengine start "gap check test"
# Have 3-4 exchanges about "quantum entanglement"
/gapcheck
```

**Validation Points**:
- [ ] Command executes without errors
- [ ] Returns concept name (e.g., "quantum entanglement")
- [ ] Shows similarity score (0.0-1.0 range)
- [ ] Provides meaningful gap analysis message
- [ ] Creates c_vector if missing (check Neo4j)
- [ ] Completes within 10 seconds

**Error Scenarios**:
- [ ] Empty session: Clear error message
- [ ] No clear concept: Appropriate error handling
- [ ] Network issues: Graceful degradation

#### 2. Metacognitive Influence Feature ✓
**Quick Test**:
```bash
peengine start "metaphor test"
# Use same metaphor 6+ times (e.g., "brain" for neural networks)
# Watch for CA behavior change
```

**Validation Points**:
- [ ] MA detects repeated metaphor usage
- [ ] CA starts prompting for new metaphors
- [ ] Persona adjustments logged in output
- [ ] Behavioral change persists across turns
- [ ] No errors during persona updates

#### 3. Session Map Feature ✓
**Quick Test**:
```bash
peengine start "mapping test"
# Discuss 4-5 related concepts to create connections
/map
```

**Validation Points**:
- [ ] Shows table of all session concepts
- [ ] Displays relationships in format: "[A] --(type)--> [B]"
- [ ] Includes connection count
- [ ] No missing data warnings
- [ ] Completes within 5 seconds

### Performance Benchmarks ✓

#### Gap Check Performance
- [ ] With existing c_vector: < 3 seconds
- [ ] With new c_vector generation: < 10 seconds
- [ ] Large session (20+ concepts): < 5 seconds

#### Session Map Performance
- [ ] Normal session (5-10 concepts): < 3 seconds
- [ ] Large session (20+ concepts): < 5 seconds
- [ ] Complex relationships (30+ edges): < 5 seconds

### Error Handling ✓

#### Network Failures
- [ ] OpenAI API unavailable: Clear error messages
- [ ] Timeout handling: No hanging operations
- [ ] Graceful degradation where possible

#### Database Issues
- [ ] Neo4j unavailable: Clear connection error
- [ ] MongoDB unavailable: Session storage error
- [ ] Corrupted data: Partial results with warnings

### Integration Validation ✓

#### Complete User Journey
1. [ ] Start session: `peengine start "integration test"`
2. [ ] Have meaningful conversation (5+ exchanges)
3. [ ] Execute `/map`: Shows concepts and relationships
4. [ ] Execute `/gapcheck`: Provides gap analysis
5. [ ] Continue conversation with repeated metaphors
6. [ ] Observe CA behavior change
7. [ ] Execute `/end`: Clean session termination

#### Cross-Feature Integration
- [ ] Gap check works after persona adjustments
- [ ] Session map includes concepts from gap analysis
- [ ] MA analysis considers gap check results
- [ ] All features work together without conflicts

## Critical Success Criteria

### Must Pass (Blocking Issues)
- [ ] All three core features execute without errors
- [ ] Gap check returns meaningful analysis (not placeholders)
- [ ] Metacognitive influence changes CA behavior
- [ ] Session map shows both nodes and relationships
- [ ] Performance meets minimum benchmarks
- [ ] Error handling prevents crashes

### Should Pass (Quality Issues)
- [ ] User experience is smooth and intuitive
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Performance exceeds target benchmarks
- [ ] Features integrate seamlessly
- [ ] System remains stable during extended use

### Nice to Have (Enhancement Opportunities)
- [ ] Advanced error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Performance optimizations for large datasets
- [ ] Enhanced user feedback and guidance
- [ ] Improved visualization of complex relationships

## Quick Commands for Testing

```bash
# Environment check
docker-compose ps && peengine --help

# Quick smoke test
peengine start "smoke test" && echo "test quantum mechanics" && echo "/gapcheck" && echo "/map"

# Performance test
time peengine start "perf test"

# Error test (stop databases first)
docker-compose stop neo4j && peengine start "error test"
```
