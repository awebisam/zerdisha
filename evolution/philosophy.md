This document outlines the core philosophical principles that ground the Personal Exploration Engine (PEEngine). These are not just design goals; they are the "why" behind the entire system.

## Core Principles:

*   **Exploration over Answers:** The system's primary function is to be a catalyst for thought, not an oracle of facts. It guides, questions, and prompts, but never dictates. This is reflected in the Socratic nature of the Conversational Agent.
*   **Metaphorical Reasoning:** The engine is built on the idea that true understanding comes from connecting disparate domains of knowledge. Metaphors are the bridges that make this possible. The system both uses and maps these metaphorical connections.
*   **Graph-based Memory:** The user's knowledge is not a collection of disconnected facts, but a graph of interconnected concepts. The Neo4j database is a direct implementation of this principle.
*   **Metacognitive Awareness:** The project embodies the idea of "learning how to learn." The Metacognitive Agent is the manifestation of this principle, providing insights into the user's own learning process.
*   **Non-dual Awareness:** Everything is interconnected. This is the ultimate philosophical stance of the project, and the knowledge graph is the tool to explore this interconnectedness.
