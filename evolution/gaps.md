# Node: Gaps

**ID:** `gaps`
**Type:** `Analysis`
**Status:** Mostly Addressed

This document identifies the current gaps between the project's vision and its implementation. The Core Solidification phase has addressed the most significant gaps.

## Remaining Gaps:

*   **Graph Visualization:** The `/map` command displays a table and textual descriptions of relationships, not a visual graph. This is the most significant remaining gap from the original vision.
*   **Vector Similarity Search:** While vector similarity is used internally for `/gapcheck`, it is not yet exposed as a direct user command to find related concepts.
