# Node: Philosophical Alignment

**ID:** `philosophy-alignment`
**Type:** `Analysis`
**Status:** âœ… Completed

This document analyzes how the current requirements for core solidification align with the foundational philosophy of the PEEngine. It serves as a metacognitive check on the development process itself.

## Alignment Analysis:

*   **Requirement 1 (`/gapcheck`):
    *   **Alignment:** **High**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This feature is a direct manifestation of **Metacognitive Awareness**. It provides the user with a tool to reflect on their own understanding without giving a simplistic "right or wrong" judgment. By showing a similarity score, it encourages further **Exploration** into the nuances of the gap, rather than just providing a direct answer.

*   **Requirement 2 (Metacognitive Influence):
    *   **Alignment:** **High**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the engine's own metacognition in action. It directly implements the principle of **Metacognitive Awareness** by having the system monitor its own dialogue patterns (e.g., "metaphor lock-in"). It actively supports **Metaphorical Reasoning** by encouraging the use of diverse and effective metaphors.

*   **Requirement 3 (`/map` Command):
    *   **Alignment:** **High**.
    *   **Reasoning:** Enhancing the `/map` command to show relationships directly reinforces the principle of **Graph-based Memory**. It moves the user's view from a simple list of concepts to an interconnected web of ideas, which is the core of the project's worldview.

*   **Requirement 4 (Testing) & 5 (Stability):
    *   **Alignment:** **Moderate but Essential**.
    *   **Reasoning:** While technical requirements like testing and stability are not philosophical goals in themselves, they are the bedrock upon which the philosophy is built. An unreliable or buggy "cognitive exoskeleton" cannot be trusted. Therefore, these requirements are essential for the user to engage with the philosophical aspects of the tool without distraction. They serve the philosophy by ensuring the tool is a seamless extension of the user's thought process.

## Conclusion:

The current requirements are strongly aligned with the project's core philosophy. They prioritize the features that make the PEEngine a tool for metacognition and exploration, rather than just another information retrieval system.
