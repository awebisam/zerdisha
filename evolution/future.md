# Node: Future Ideas

**ID:** `future`
**Type:** `Enhancement`

This document captures potential future enhancements for the PEEngine, now that the core features are solidified.

## Planned Features:

*   **TUI Graph Visualization:** Implement a visual representation of the knowledge graph in the terminal, moving beyond the current table-based view.
*   **Vector Similarity Search Command:** Expose the `find_similar_concepts` method through a new CLI command, allowing users to find concepts related to a given idea.
*   **Multi-Session Learning Trajectories:** Enhance the analytics to track learning patterns and concept evolution across multiple sessions, providing a longitudinal view of the user's progress.
*   **Export Capabilities:** Allow users to export their knowledge graphs and session data into standard formats (e.g., JSON, GraphML).
*   **Automated MA Influence Loop:** Move beyond the command-based `/apply_ma` to a fully automated loop where the MA's suggestions can dynamically and proactively adjust the CA's persona during a session without user intervention.
*   **Enhanced Analytics Dashboard:** Develop a more comprehensive review and status dashboard, potentially with historical performance metrics.
